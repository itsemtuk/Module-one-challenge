# Module One Challenge

# Horiseon Accsessibility Optimisation


## Summary





## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

The Website will meet accessibility standards. I can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)
